# Wrench

## For development follow these steps:
- Fork repo
- Clone files locally
- run `npm install`
- start up the application with `npm start`

### Release History
Current release is still in alpha stages. Certain conditions are required to ensure proper functioning on your machine. NPM must be preinstalled and configured in your PATH in order to run the subcommands for the backend of the program.
If npm is not on your machine I recommend visiting [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download the current version
