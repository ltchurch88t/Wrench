# Wrench

## Current Release
[Release V.0.9](https://github.com/ltchurch88t/Wrench/releases/tag/0.9)

## For development follow these steps:
- Fork repo
- Clone files locally
- run `npm install`
- start up the application with `npm start`

### Release History
Current release is still in alpha stages. Certain conditions are required to ensure proper functioning on your machine. NPM must be preinstalled and configured in your PATH in order to run the subcommands for the backend of the program.
If npm is not on your machine I recommend visiting [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download the current version

#### Notes
In future releases the need to have commands run separately from the internal of the program should be eliminated helping to smooth out the install process if an individual was to not have precompiled Node and npm on their machines.

This is only a mac application at the moment.
